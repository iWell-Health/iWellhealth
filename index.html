            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>The story of iWell begins with two passionate innovators, Innocent Menyo and Noah Ronald Ggayi, who share a vision to transform how individuals monitor and manage their health. Hailing from Uganda, these visionary co-founders bring a unique blend of medical expertise, entrepreneurial drive, and a deep commitment to improving healthcare access worldwide.</p>
            <p>Their flagship innovation, the iWell Bio Tracker, is a game-changing wearable device designed to address one of the world’s silent killers: high blood pressure. Innocent often highlights the critical importance of early awareness, stating, “The real risk lies in not knowing your blood pressure status. Many patients only seek help when complications are already severe.”</p>

            <p>Building on their success, iWell is excited to soon launch a new version of the Bio Tracker designed specifically for the detection of pre-eclampsia, a serious pregnancy-related condition linked to high blood pressure. This new iteration will provide a vital tool for expectant mothers and healthcare providers, enabling earlier detection and management of pre-eclampsia, ultimately improving maternal and fetal health outcomes.</p>
